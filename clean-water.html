    <p>
      I participated in a United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) engineering challenge, contributing to a solution that addresses SDG 14.1: reducing marine pollution. 
      Our team designed the <strong>MACH 1</strong>, a fully mechanical marine waste compactor aimed at small to medium-sized boats.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Marine vessels contribute over 20% of global plastic pollution. Many sailors dispose of waste overboard due to lack of space and odor concerns. 
      The MACH 1 solves this by providing an efficient, compact waste management solution that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduces waste volume by 66% using a 3:1 compaction ratio</li>
      <li>Operates without electricity via a hand-cranked scissor jack system</li>
      <li>Eliminates odor through air compression and sealed liners</li>
      <li>Resists corrosion with marine-grade Aluminum 6061-T6 and protective coatings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      I was responsible for the 3D CAD modeling and mechanical part drawings of the MACH 1. I created detailed component schematics including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The internal scissor jack compaction mechanism</li>
      <li>Custom gear system for torque transmission</li>
      <li>Removable bin liner and waste compartment</li>
      <li>Gearbox housing, crankshaft integration, and bearing alignment</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Engineering Highlights</h2>
    <h3>Scissor Jack System</h3>
    <p>
      The hand-cranked scissor jack uses a 1 cm lead screw pitch with 20 cm arms, achieving a mechanical advantage of 20. This allows users to generate over 22kN of force with minimal effort. 
    </p>

    <h3>Gear Transmission</h3>
    <p>
      The gearbox uses a 15:30 spur gear ratio in a parallel shaft configuration. A flexible shaft transmits torque from the crank to the lead screw while compensating for vertical motion of the jack. 
      Human power input (~50W) converts into ~8Nm torque, well above the required 1.75Nm for compaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Material Selection</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Internal Bin & Plate:</strong> Aluminum 6061-T6 (yield strength ≥ 244 MPa, corrosion resistant, lightweight)</li>
      <li><strong>Outer Housing:</strong> Same material with 2 mm wall thickness for stiffness and safety</li>
      <li><strong>Lid Plate:</strong> 10 mm thick aluminum plate with a 3.3x safety factor against maximum stress</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact Resistance & Durability</h3>
    <p>
      Designed to survive 1-meter drops with full waste load (~51kg). Design considerations included shock distribution, retention ring-supported gear shafts, and bearing-mounted supports to reduce vibration and misalignment.
    </p>

    <h2>Outcomes & Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The MACH 1 presents a novel, compact waste management solution for the marine sector. It’s 6.7x lighter than industrial competitors, requires no electronics, and offers affordable, robust functionality tailored for yachts and small boats.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project helped me apply mechanical design theory to real-world sustainability problems, blending CAD, gear mechanics, and stakeholder-centered engineering. It also showcased how AI tools like ChatGPT can support decision-making during prototyping and materials analysis.
